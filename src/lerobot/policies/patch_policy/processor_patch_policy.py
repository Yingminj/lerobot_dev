    """Build the pre- and post-processing pipelines for Patch Policy.

    Same structure as VQ-BeT's, and for the same reason: `VISUAL` normalization is `IDENTITY`
    because the frozen ViTs apply their own (ImageNet, or their HF processor's) mean/std to pixels
    in [0, 1], exactly as the reference encoders do. Normalizing here would double-normalize.

    Actions are normalized to [-1, 1] (`MIN_MAX`). That replaces the reference's `act_scale`
    constant — Push-T and Cube divide raw actions by 500 before the VQ-VAE sees them, which is a
    hand-set stand-in for the dataset statistics lerobot already tracks.

    Args:
        config: The Patch Policy configuration.
        dataset_stats: Statistics used for normalization.

    Returns:
        The configured pre-processor and post-processor pipelines.
